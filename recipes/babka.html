        <em> Babka is a sweet dough rolled in chocolate cream(can have other fillings, 
         but in this specific recipe it's <br> gonna be chocolate ), a bread with origin in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe
         and was taken <br> by immigrants to the United States, becoming popular in the bakeries of New York. And it's, honestly, <br>
         one of the best things I have ever cooked and eaten! </em>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First of all, weigh 80 g of unsalted butter, cut into cubes and let it soften at room temperature. Let's use this butter at the end of the kneading</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>We start by making a sponge, add 60 g of wheat flour 4 g instant dry yeast and 60 g of water at room temperature</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>In the mixer with the gaucho: 340g of flour + 50g of sugar + Sponge + 2 eggs + 60g of cold milk - low speed for 5 minutes</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>If you notice dryness, add 20g of milk and beat for another 5 minutes</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>The ideal is when one part is in the bowl and the other is wrapped around the hook</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Start kneading: 10 minutes at medium speed</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Add the 80 grams of butter from the beginning: 5 minutes on low speed</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Add 80 g of unsalted butter, the one we left to soften at room temperature at the beginning of the recipe</li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Then another 10 minutes at medium speed</li>

        <br>

        <li>Close the dough with plastic wrap and let it ferment for 30 minutes at room temperature</li>
            
        <br>

        <li>Place in the fridge and leave to ferment for another 30 minutes</li>
          
        <br>

        <li>Meanwhile, the topping: 60 g of butter in a pan without salt + 90 grams of milk chocolate mix until it melts and then turn off the heat + 20 g of refined or icing sugar + 1 g of corn starch + 20 g of cocoa in powder </li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Roll out the dough into a rectangle without tearing it </li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Apply the filling + chopped chocolate and roll </li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Cut in half with a serrated knife and lock with the cut side up and then join the loose ends</li><br>
        
        <br>

        <li>Place on parchment paper very well greased with butter or oil inside the pan</li>

        <br>

        <li>Ferment again in an hour in the meantime, preheat the oven to 180 degrees, just in the lower part of the heat</li>
        
        <br>
        
        <li>After fermenting, put it to bake</li>
        
        <br>

        <li> Place mold underneath so it doesn't get dirty, after 15 minutes, turn the pan over (If it browns too quickly, add aluminum foil)</li>

        <br>

        <li>Another thirty minutes to get ready</li>

        <br>

        <li>While still hot, brush on a syrup of 50g of refined sugar plus the same amount of boiled water; Leave to cool on a rack</li>
